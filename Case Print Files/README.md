# Infernum Case Print Files
Note: These case files are intended to be used with Infernum PCB & switch plate. M2 self threading screws and SKUF silicone rubber feet are required for assembly.  
These case files have been tested and confirmed working, but I accept no liability for faulty prints using these files.
