PCBs have been tested before shipping, however, it is always best to test a PCB before soldering as a precaution. If you are using encoders and/or stabilizers, make sure to install them before soldering on switches, as it will not be possible afterwards. Please reference the layout numbering in the below KLE when soldering the space bar switches. The layouts are numbered below each switch position on the PCB.

This skeleton kit is the same as most other skeleton kits, with the distinguishing factor being the use of countersunk screws. All counter sunk screws are to be used on the bottom side of the acrylic bottom plate and foot. The photos below depict each step in the assembly process.

Step 1 (Optional): If typing angle is desired, attach foot to bottom plate using M2x8mm counter sunk screws and M2 hex nuts. Counter sunk holes on foot and bottom plate must be facing the same direction.
