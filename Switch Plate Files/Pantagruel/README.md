# Pantagruel Plate Files
As with any EC build, you will need to screw the PCB to the switch plate.
- For an OEM Topre build or Topre clone (Deskeys, Densus, etc.) with threaded plate, order the threaded plate file with M2-0.4 threads. You will need 18 x M2x8mm screws, standard screw head is okay and will not have interference.

- For an OEM Topre build or Topre clone (Deskeys, Densus, etc.) with through hole plate, you will need 18 x M2x10mm screws AND 18 x M2 nuts. Ultra low profile screw heads are required to eliminate keycap interference. Head diameter 4mm or less is preferred.

- For an AEBoards Naevies build with threaded plate, order the threaded plate file with M2-0.4 threads. You will need 18 x M2x6mm screws, standard screw head is okay and will not have interference.

- For an AEBoards Naevies build with through hole plate (includes thick plate file above). You will need 18 x M2x8mm screws AND 18 x M2 nuts, standard screw head is okay and will not have interference. Head diameter 4mm or less is preferred.
