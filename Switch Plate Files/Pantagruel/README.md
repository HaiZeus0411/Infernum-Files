# Pantagruel Plate Files
As with any EC build, you will need to screw the PCB to the switch plate. Please reference below information when ordering switch plates. Thin plates for topre work best in metal - plastic thin plates are too flimsy.
- For an OEM Topre build or Topre clone (Deskeys, Densus, etc.) with threaded plate, order the threaded plate file with 1.2mm thickness and M2-0.4 threads. You will need 18 x M2x8mm screws, standard screw head is okay and will not have interference.

- For an OEM Topre build or Topre clone (Deskeys, Densus, etc.) with through hole plate, order the through hole plate file with 1.2mm thickness and no threads. You will need 18 x M2x10mm screws AND 18 x M2 nuts. Ultra low profile screw heads are required to eliminate keycap interference. Head diameter 4mm or less is preferred.

- For an AEBoards Naevies build with threaded plate, order the threaded plate file with 1.5mm thickness and M2-0.4 threads. You will need 18 x M2 screws, 6mm length should work but is untested, 8mm length is a bit long but has no interference. Standard screw head is okay and will not have interference.

- For an AEBoards Naevies build with through hole plate (includes thick plate file above), order the through hole plate file with 1.5mm thickness and no threads. You will need 18 x M2x8mm screws AND 18 x M2 nuts, standard screw head is okay and will not have interference. Head diameter 4mm or less is preferred.
